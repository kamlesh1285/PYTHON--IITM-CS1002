# Solve all the below tasks related to variables.

#This exercise gives you practice in working with variables.

#Note: Do not take input or print output as they are taken care by the suffix code(evaluator).

x1 = input()
x2 = input()
y1 = input()
y2 = input()
y3 = input()
z = input()

# swap the values of `x1` and `x2`
x1, x2 = x2, x1

# do a circular swap of `y1`, `y2` and `y3`  like y1 = y2, y2 = y3, y3 = y1 
y1, y2, y3 = y2, y3, y1
# create a new variable `a` with the value of `z`
a = z

# delete the variable `z`
del z

print(x1)
print(x2)
print(y1)
print(y2)
print(y3)
print(a)
